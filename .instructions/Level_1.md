# KBTG Techtopia Codeoff
### Instructions

Create a CLI rock-paper-scissors game that prompts the player for a choice between `rock` `paper` or `scissors`, randomizes the computer choice, and find out who's the winner. The program should keep track of the current round's winner, the player's score, the computer's score, and the number of games played.


### Supported languages

4. Python

### Setup 

1. Sign in to GitHub via the popup using the provided credentials.

2. Clone the specified repository

3. Open the cloned project in Visual Studio Code

4. Make sure that GitHub Copilot is running in your editor by testing a short comment prompt: `// write a rock-paper-scissors game` 

5. Get started writing code!

======================== Please wait for the MCs to announce the start ========================



### Challenge #1 - Write the rock-paper-scissors program
Create a file to write your rock-paper-scissors game with an extension of your choice.




### Tasks

- The CLI prompts the user for an input between `rock` `paper` or `scissors`
- The program randomizes the computer choice
- The CLI outputs the round's result after the user submits the choice as follow
    ```
    Please input your choice >>> paper

    The computer chose: rock
    The player choice: paper
    The winner is: player
    Wins: 1
    Losses: 0
    Games played: 1
    ======================== 

    Please input your choice >>> 

    ...
    ```
- After each round, the game prompts the player for the new choice and the game continues until the program is closed 
- Commit and push your code to git

### Bonus!

- The program checks for invalid user choice and asks the user to provide a valid input again. The program should not continue until the user provides a valid input.
